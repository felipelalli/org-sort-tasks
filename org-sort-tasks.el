(defun org-sort-tasks ()
  "An interactive fn that sorts a list of tasks in the selected region or under the headline on cursor.

There are two main ways of use:

1) You can let the cursor above any position of a headline and press M-x org-sort-tasks.
2) You can select a region and use M-x org-sort-tasks.

The user will be prompted to reply a simple question like \"Is 'xxx task' SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE 'yyy task'?\". After reply some questions, the fn will open a new buffer and build a sorted list of tasks. It is very useful for who uses GTD method and work with huge unsorted lists of tasks."
